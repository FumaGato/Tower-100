Small text based rpg rogue-like game made by me for learning how to code.
Here's a few thing I want to add in the game:
- boss
- more items
- more weapon
- balance a little bit maybe (maybe done?)
- add skill buff after defeating certain number of enemies maybe if I'm not lazy ig
- difficulty increase (done)
- player level up system
